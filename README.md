The Mayhem Project is an open source social network platform generator. In other words, you can download the project and run `mayhem` to generate the code for an entire social network platform that you can host anywhere/anyhow you want. To set up out-of-the-box hosting and get up and running within minutes, check out Mayday, our official hosting platform.
